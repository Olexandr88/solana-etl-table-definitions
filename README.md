# Solana ETL Table Definitions

This repo contains table definitions for [Solana](https://solana.com/).

If you want to parse logs and instructions on Solana and make them cheaper to query on BigQuery, feel free to submit a PR with your new table definitions.

The tables will be available in the `blockchain-etl.solana_{dataset}` dataset, e.g.:

```
SELECT *
FROM blockchain-etl.solana_mango.MangoMarketsV3_event_WithdrawLog 
WHERE date(block_timestamp) = '2022-04-21'
```

## How To Submit New Table Definitions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch and upload your new files to this branch.
3. Create a PR to merge to this main repository.
4. Wait for it to be reviewed and merged, your BigQuery tables should show up shortly under the \_\_ project.
5. Now you can query your newly parsed tables more efficiently and for a smaller cost.

## My Dataset doesn't show up?

Certain datasets are currently private while others are public.
If your blockchain is considered private, please sign up for a Nansen Query Plan with your google cloud account.
You will then be able to access theses private datasets.
